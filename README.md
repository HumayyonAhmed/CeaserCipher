# Caesar Cipher Tool 🔐

A simple JavaScript web app that encrypts text using the Caesar cipher algorithm with password-based shifting.

## 🔍 What is Caesar Cipher?

The Caesar cipher is a classic encryption technique where each letter in the plaintext is shifted a certain number of positions in the alphabet.

This tool improves on the original by allowing you to input a password — the shift is then derived from that password for added security.
